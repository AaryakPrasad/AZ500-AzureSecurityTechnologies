# Lab Scenario Preview: AZ-500: Manage Identity and Access - Part A

## Lab 01: Role-Based Access Control
You have been asked to create a proof of concept showing how Azure users and groups are created. Also, how role-based access control is used to assign roles to groups. Specifically, you need to:

- Create a Senior Admins group containing the user account of Joseph Price as its member.
- Create a Junior Admins group containing the user account of Isabel Garcia as its member.
- Create a Service Desk group containing the user account of Dylan Williams as its member.
- Assign the Virtual Machine Contributor role to the Service Desk group.
